    <h1>Ahoy! Let's show ye the ropes!</h1>
   
    <div class="square">
        <p>Welcome aboard our fearsome brigantine, the Poulterheist! You’re to be our navigator as we sail this dangerous ocean... 
            what were we doing before you arrived you ask? <br>
            Oh we had a navigator but they- uh, had some family matters to attend to.<br>
            Why yes I am a giant chicken! And a pi- er, sailor. And this is my dear crew!<br>
            ... as you can see we are all chickens - so you’ll be earning your pay by doing all the debugging for us!

        <h2>How To Play:</h2>
        <p>The journey to the fabled Island of Java is dangerous, and along the way you’ll have to make quick but carefully 
            considered decisions on how we are to navigate the obstacles and situations that will arise.<br>
            The crew is adept at displaying the problems quickly and in the Java programming language.<br>
            Your job will be to select the correct option to the problem by clicking on your desired solution below each problem. <br>
            The crew will compile it for you and we’ll be safe!<br>
            We’ll need to successfully complete the, I estimate, four challenges that lie between us and the beans.<br>
            The crew of the Poulterheist is fast! But should you falter and pick the wrong option we won't be able to continue!<br>
            If you can navigate us with all the correct solutions to our problems we'll make it no time.
