    <title>An Array of Cannons</title>
    <h1>Cornfall - Return fire!</h1>
    <h2>An Array of some Cannons</h2>
    <p>We've taken hits! Through sheer coincidence our lookout is reporting that they're sailing the <strong>exact kind of ship!</strong></p>
    <p>The code for their cannon array is below, if their cannons have fired from their starboard side and hit exactly their exact counterparts on our port but in reverse...<br>
    i.e. Their 1st Starboard Cannon hit and destroyed our 6th Port cannon, what cannons do we have left to fire with?</p>
